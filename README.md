LiveSplit.CompletionEstimate
============================

This LiveSplit component displays an estimate of what percentage of your run is complete.

**Download:** [LiveSplit.CompletionEstimate.dll](https://github.com/TheSoundDefense/LiveSplit.CompletionEstimate/raw/master/Components/LiveSplit.CompletionEstimate.dll)

To use this component, download the above DLL file and place it in the Components folder of your LiveSplit installation. This component will appear under the **Information** category.

By default, the estimated completion is based on your current comparison and timing method. This can be adjusted in the Layout Settings.

If you do not have a completed run (or, more specifically, if your chosen splits do not have a time for the final split), a completion estimate cannot be displayed.
